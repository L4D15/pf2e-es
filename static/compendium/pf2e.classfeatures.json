You might commune with powerful psychopomps who shepherd souls to the afterlife, with the River of Souls itself, or with those spirits who have become trapped outside of the great cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows them to meddle in your worldly affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Mystery Benefit</strong> The whispers of your ancestors have bestowed additional knowledge upon you.

Your hair, clothing, and belongings constantly shift and stir, seemingly of their own volition.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Curse</strong> One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll [[/r 1d4]] on Table 2-4: Ancestral Influence (see below) to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type of action. When you try to use one of the types of actions listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don't lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell). If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it's long enough that you can overcome the meddling, and you don't need to attempt a flat check.</p>\n<p>During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions.

For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you're hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.<br /></p>\n<p>If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don't require those class features.

			"description": "<p>Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific source. You can learn focus spells only through special class features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points-you can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly, you can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells. Even some classes that don't normally grant spellcasting, such as the @Compendium[pf2e.classes.QzgMYQWYdQZMIChe]{Champion} and @Compendium[pf2e.classes.8KGkzwIFYFHAdw2H]{Monk}, can grant focus spells.<br /><br />Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, just like cantrips are. You can't cast a focus spell if its minimum level is greater than half your level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.<br /><br />Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point. You automatically gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point the first time you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell.<br /><br />You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain a Focus Point.<br /><br />Some abilities allow you to increase the Focus Points in your pool beyond 1. Typically, these are feats that give you a new focus spell and increase the number of points in your pool by 1. Your focus pool can't have a capacity beyond 3 Focus Points, even if feats that increase your pool would cause it to exceed this number.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To regain focus points, see the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} action.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Spellcasters with Focus Spells</h1>\n<p>Source<strong>Core Rulebook pg. 302</strong><br />If you are a spellcaster, your focus spells are the same tradition of spell as the class that gave you the focus spell. A @Compendium[pf2e.classes.8l1uexxIX7m6LUUv]{Bard's} are @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.fEOj0eOBe34qYdAa]{Occult}, a @Compendium[pf2e.classes.Oia1kqkF4KwdVVaw]{Cleric's} are @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.AvNbdGSOTWNRgcxs]{Divine}, a @Compendium[pf2e.classes.JSkS9iLsebH2HUSY]{Druid's} are @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.b8pnRxGuNzG0buuh]{Primal}, a @Compendium[pf2e.classes.O6rpIOJQM78U9eyU]{Wizard's} are @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.S6WW4Yyg4XonXGHD]{Arcane}, and a @Compendium[pf2e.classes.WpMQGtgz46Cc5onF]{Sorcerer's} are determined by their bloodline.<br /></p>\n<h1>Non-Spellcasters with Focus Spells</h1>\n<p>Source <strong>Core Rulebook pg. 302</strong><br />If you get focus spells from a class or other source that doesn't grant spellcasting ability (for example, if you're a @Compendium[pf2e.classes.8KGkzwIFYFHAdw2H]{Monk} with the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3a07jkWezSuORSpS]{Ki Strike} feat), the ability that gives you focus spells also provides your proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs, as well as the magical tradition of your focus spells. You gain the ability to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} and use any spellcasting actions necessary to cast your focus spells (see below). However, you don't qualify for feats and other rules that require you to be a spellcaster.</p>"

			"description": "<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.<br /><br />Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br /><br />As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day on page 193.<br /><br />Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (page 299). The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;

			"description": "<p>A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and counter the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters. Whether you're a member of a superstitious family or culture that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant battle against wizards and witches, a survivor of a magical accident that instilled an intense aversion in your mind and body, or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic.</p>\n<p>This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those of other instincts.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Willingly accepting the effects of magic spells (including from scrolls, wands, and the like), even from your allies, is anathema to your instinct. You can still drink potions and invest and activate most magic items you find, though items that cast spells are subject to the same restrictions as all other spells. If an ally insists on using magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel with that ally of your own free will counts as willingly accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and thus is also anathema to your instinct.</p>\n<h2>Supersticious Resiliance (Instinct Ability)</h2>\n<p>While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from 2 to 4 against creatures that can cast spells. Once every 10 minutes, when you Rage, you regain Hit Points equal to the temporary Hit Points you gain from that Rage action.</p>\n<h2>Specialization Ability                                  7th</h2>\n<p>Increase the damage from Rage from 4 to 8 against creatures that can cast spells. If you have greater raging specialization, instead increase the damage from Rage to 12 against creatures with spells and 8 against other creatures.</p>\n<h2>Raging Resistance                                        9th</h2>\n<p>Choose two associated magical traditions: arcane and occult, arcane and primal, divine and occult, or divine and primal. The resistance from your raging resistance class feature applies against all damage you take from spells cast with these two traditions of magic, regardless of the type of damage dealt by the spell.</p>"
