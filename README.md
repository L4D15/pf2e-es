## FoundryVTT Pathfinder 2E ES

Translation to Spanish of the Pathfinder 2E system for Foundry VTT. This module does NOT contain compendium, only the base system translation.

## How can I collaborate?

Localization is done in [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/none-738/foundryvtt-pathfinder-2e-es/content/), so feel to create an account there and contact me (L4D15#2706) to give you access.

## Building the project locally

You can download the repo and try it yourself. It has a very simple webpack configuration, just install dependencies with `npm install`, configure your path to Foundry's data folder in `foundryconfig.json` and run `npm run build` to perform a one time build. The resulting module will be automatically copied to the modules folder in your foundry installation.
