## FoundryVTT Pathfinder 2E ES

Translation to Spanish of the Pathfinder 2E system for Foundry VTT. Compendium content is been translated, but its scope is greater than what we can translate currently, so don't expect every single entry in the compendium to be translated. Consider contributing to the translation to speed up the process (see below).

## How can I collaborate?

Localization is done in [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/none-738/foundryvtt-pathfinder-2e-es/content/), so feel to create an account there and contact me (L4D15#2706) to give you access.

## Building the project locally

You can download the repo and try it yourself. It has a very simple webpack configuration, just install dependencies with `npm install`, configure your path to Foundry's data folder in `foundryconfig.json` and run `npm run build` to perform a one time build. The resulting module will be automatically copied to the modules folder in your foundry installation.
